An input delay is missing on reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on butt_led relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
